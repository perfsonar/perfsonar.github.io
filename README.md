# perfsonar.github.io

This repository is just needed so we can use GitHub pages under the various projct directories (example the docs repository hosted at docs.perfsonar.net). It basically tells Github to look for custom CNAMES under the various project directories. If we ever want to host a github organization site, we can do so here but right now you should not be comitting anything to this repository.
